% csolve  Solves a custom quadratic program very rapidly.
%
% [vars, status] = csolve(params, settings)
%
% solves the convex optimization problem
%
%   minimize(sum(abs(YBu - CA*x)))
%
% with variables
%        x   4 x 1
%
% and parameters
%       CA 140 x 4
%      YBu 140 x 1
%
% Note:
%   - Check status.converged, which will be 1 if optimization succeeded.
%   - You don't have to specify settings if you don't want to.
%   - To hide output, use settings.verbose = 0.
%   - To change iterations, use settings.max_iters = 20.
%   - You may wish to compare with cvxsolve to check the solver is correct.
%
% Specify params.CA, ..., params.YBu, then run
%   [vars, status] = csolve(params, settings)
